# Tumblr Themes

I've migrated my themes from Pastebin to here. 

~~Purely because it doesn't allow unlimited unlisted pastes anymore~~

**About This: (Licensing Still Applies)**

* Any code/file listed as Personal etc in the folder's readme.md and inside the code Is NOT available for redistribution and will probably be unfinished/bugged.

* Under no circumstances may you redistribute under any other name or edit my work without permission. If you do want to work on them, that's great! Just please let me know!

* I do not help with customising any theme, but if there is a technical issue send me a message on Tumblr or leave an issue. 

**Previews:**

##### Theme 3

##### Theme 4 

##### Theme 5
