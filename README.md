##### About this repo

- Most of my code is for use with [Discord](https://discord.com), [Tumblr](https://tumblr.com), [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/Jiiks/BetterDiscordApp) and [plug.dj](https://plug.dj). This will be stated in the readme.md and by designated folder. 

- Note: Most of these files are either slightly broken or completely broken. Most of these files are here due to pastebin's new limited uploading.

- Under **no circumstances** may you redistribute under any other name or edit my work without permission. If you do want to work on them, that's great! Just please let me know!
