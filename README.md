### About This Repo

- Most of my code is for use with [Discord](https://discord.com), [Tumblr](https://tumblr.com) and [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/Jiiks/BetterDiscordApp). This will be stated in the readme.md and by designated folder.
- Note: Most of these files are either slightly broken or completely broken. Most of these files are here due to pastebin's new limited uploading.
- This repo also counts as my CSS/HTML portfolio due to the fact  I can no longer host unlimited hidden pastes on pastebin and it's easier to use GitHub.
- Under **no circumstances** may you redistribute under any other name. If you do want to work on them, that's great! Just please let me know! Open as many pull requests or issues as you'd like.
