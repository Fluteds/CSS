### About

Most of my code is for use with [Discord](https://discord.com), [Spicetify](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli), [Tumblr](https://tumblr.com) and [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/Jiiks/BetterDiscordApp). 

Information for each platform will be stated in the `readme` and by designated folder.
