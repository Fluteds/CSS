### About

Most of my code is for use with [Discord](https://discord.com), [Spicetify](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli), [Tumblr](https://tumblr.com) and [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/Jiiks/BetterDiscordApp). 

Information for each platform will be stated in the `readme` and by designated folder.

**Please note**

- Most of these files are either slightly broken or completely broken. 
- All of these files are here due to Pastebin's new limited unlisted uploading.
- This repo also counts as my CSS/HTML portfolio.
- Under no circumstances may you redistribute under any other name. 
- If you do want to work on these, that's great! Just please let me know! 
- Open as many pull requests or issues as you'd like.
